# BlackJack Game by Carlos Ramirez
## How to Play
Begin the game by pressing 'Start Game'. The Ace is worth 11 points. Face cards are worth 10 and non face cards are worth their normal value. You have two actions you can take once you receive your hand: 'Hit Me' or 'Stand'. If you press 'Hit Me', you will receive another card. If you exceed a hand value of 21, you will bust and the dealer wins. If you press 'Stand', the dealer will continue to hit until the value of their hand is 17 or greater or until a bust. Your hand value will then be compared to the dealers hand value if both hand values are 21 or less. If your hand value is greater than the dealer's hand value, you will win and one point will be added to the scoreboard for the player. If your hand value is the same as the dealer's, then the round will end in a draw. If your hand value is less than the dealer's, you lose the round and a point will be added to the scoreboard for the dealer. The next round should be initiated after a bust or a winner is determined by pressing the 'Next Round' button.
